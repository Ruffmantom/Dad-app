# Dad Life

Dad Life is a application that lets a user create an online dad profile to share "dad" moments and dad jokes with the community.
The user will also be able to save dad jokes to their profile for future revisiting.
Other users will be able to like or comment on the dad moments or dad jokes that get posted in the community page.

### This is where the jokes are coming in from an api call. Future development concept is to save these to the users profile. Once the user wants to sign out or get off they can simply press the icon at the top right corner.
